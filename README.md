# Loan Utilization Tracking System  
### AI-Driven, Fraud-Resistant End-User Expense Verification 

> Ensuring that sanctioned funds are utilized **only for their intended purpose**, with verifiable proof at every step.

---

## Problem Statement

Post-disbursement loan monitoring is largely opaque. Existing systems lack:

- Visibility after fund release  
- Reliable verification of invoices and purchases  
- Assurance that assets are bought at approved locations  
- Scalable mechanisms to prevent fraud and misuse  

As a result, manual audits are slow, error-prone, and ineffective.

---

## Proposed Solution

An **end-to-end loan utilization tracking platform** that binds every spending event to:

**Beneficiary · Asset · Location · Time · Proof**

using AI-based verification and cryptographic integrity guarantees.

## System Capabilities

### 1. Proof-Based Spending Verification
- Borrowers submit:
  - Purchase invoice
  - On-site photograph of the acquired asset
- Each submission becomes a traceable verification event.

---

### 2. AI Verification Pipeline

**Invoice Analysis**
- OCR extraction of vendor, item, amount, GST, and date  
- Duplicate and reused invoice detection  
- Tamper and format anomaly checks  

**Asset Validation**
- Object detection to confirm sanctioned asset category  
- Mismatch and substitution detection  

**Location Binding**
- Geo-coordinates extracted at capture time  
- Geo-fencing ensures purchases occur at approved sites

### 3. Fraud Prevention & Integrity Controls

- Device fingerprinting  
- IMU / GPS consistency validation  
- Replay attack prevention  
- Hash-linked proof records  
- Consent and submission audit trails
